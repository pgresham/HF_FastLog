## Stripped Down Amateur Radio Logging GUI
--------
### How To Use
Running the Python script with the required packages installed, HF Fastlog will open a GUI into which logs can be entered.
Upon initial startup the program will create a subdirectory called "logs" into which the logfiles will be saved in a plaintex format.
Logs are generated for each day with the format [yyyy-mm-dd].log with spaced text entries corresponding to the line entered in the UI text fields.
