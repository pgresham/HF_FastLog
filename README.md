# HF FastLog
## Stripped Down Amateur Radio Logging GUI
--------
### How To Use
Running the Python script with the required packages installed, HF Fastlog will open a GUI into which logs can be entered.
Upon initial startup the program will create a subdirectory called "logs" into which the logfiles will be saved in a plaintex format.
Logs are generated for each day with the format `yyyy-mm-dd.log` with spaced text entries corresponding to the line entered in the UI text fields.

### Anything Else to Know?
Nope, that's pretty much it. This is designed to be simple! 

### [Here's the most current version (2.0.1)](https://github.com/pgresham/HF_FastLog/blob/master/FastLog2_0_1.py)
It is made to work in Python 3.x.x and requires Tkinter to be installed if it isn't already present.
